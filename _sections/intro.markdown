## Let's open the city we love to all

New York City doesn't have enough housing and the housing we have is incredible segregated. Our high prices, rising rents, crowded apartments and rolling tide of displacement have the same root cause: our housing shortage.

We're tenants who want to see all neighborhoods add homes, especially high-opportunity neighborhoods. It's not fair to focus development on the neighborhoods with the least political power. We can do better.

Let's open our neighborhoods to more housing so that our neighbors, friends and family can stay. We want more tenant bargaining power, more integration, more equity, and more access to the best city in the world.

## Get involved

Come to public meetings. Write and call your elected officials. Tell your friends. Meet us at our events.

Housing and land-use is political. Politics is about organizing, showing up, and talking about it. Let's make our city even better.
