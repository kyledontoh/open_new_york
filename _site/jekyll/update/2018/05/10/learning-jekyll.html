				<h2>Not-So-Strange Bedfellows</h2>

<h1 id="what-happened-in-thailand">What happened in Thailand?</h1>

<p>In October 1973, a popular uprising in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand" title="Thailand - Wikipedia, the Free Encylopedia">Thailand</a>, led by student activists and supported by a broad spectrum of Bangkok’s residents, successfully brought an end to a military regime. Once again in May 1992, it seemed that much the same story unfolded in the streets of the capital, as a far larger and more politically conscious middle class—the “mobile phone mob”, as they were called—was at the forefront of protests to end yet another military regime and restore democracy. To many observers, the 1992 crisis seemed to herald the political coming of age of the generation that had led the 1973 protests as politically engaged urban middle class, primarily at the expense of the military and government bureaucracy that had dominated Thai politics for the previous six decades. This, for many, seemed usher in a truly transformative process, one that culminated in the promulgation of a new constitution in 1997—popularly termed the “People’s Constitution”— considered to be the most liberal in the country’s history.</p>

<h2 id="then-what-happened">Then what happened?</h2>

<p>But less than a decade after the 1997 constitution came into force, any hopes for a new age of Thai democracy had been shattered by a military coup in 2006, following widespread protests against the populist government of Thaksin Shinawatra, who had risen to dominate the post-1997 political landscape. After a brief period of military rule, the pro-Thaksin coalition regained power under a succession of short-lived premiers, before falling to the pressures of court bans and further mass protests and losing power to the opposition in 2008.Thaksin’s sister Yingluck was able to secure a majority in the 2011 elections, but her government was deposed in yet another coup last year, once again following months of protests essentially calling for one.</p>

<h3 id="and-then-what">And then what?</h3>
<p>The composition of the anti-Thaksin coalitions in 2006, 2008, and 2014, when compared to those opposing the military in 1973 and 1992, seems fairly shocking at first glance—for they largely overlap. The primary base of the anti-Thaksin protests were also the members of the urban middle classes, Indeed, many of the very same figures who had condemned military rule in prior decades in many cases now called for it in all but name, if not openly. People who had once taken to the streets calling for and popular government and electoral democracy now demanded an unelected “reform council” while attempting to prevent an election from taking place! Long-time critics of the military and royalist establishments seemed to have united with them in opposing the elected government.</p>

<h3 id="the-role-of-sarit">The role of Sarit</h3>

<p>Sarit revived the monarchy’s status in society, using it to support his agenda of <em>phatthana</em> (development), as King Bhumibol began his famous tours of the countryside, with the aim of forging a close link between the monarchy and a rural population long ignored by Bangkok governments (Kershaw 2001, 137). As the process of economic development led to the emergence of drastic changes to Thai society, the monarchy proved adept at legitimizing such changes and new classes of society—in particular the hitherto “alien” Sino-Thai merchant class—by extending over them its royal charisma, or <em>barami</em>, through royal patronage or ritual merit-making ceremonies, through which the monarchy was also able to build a substantial financial reserve, reducing its operational dependence on the government of the day (Connors 2011, 659).</p>

<p>Despite Sarit’s death in 1963 and the return of Thanom (this time propped up by Field Marshal Praphas Charusathian, Commander-in-Chief of the Army) to the premiership, business, particularly the service sector, expanded at a brisk pace, people in the countryside flocked to the cities, particularly Bangkok, and the educational sector grew rapidly, if erratically (Chaloemtiarana 1979, 227). By 1972, over 100,000 students were enrolled in universities, compared to just 18,000 nine years prior (Jäger 2012, 1141). This necessitated correspondingly tremendous growth in the number of academics and administrative works, as well as positions to absorb this newly university-educated generation; the number of administrative workers and government officials, according to census figures, grew by <strong>over 840%</strong> between 1960 and 1970 (Ockey 1999, 235).</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> perhaps even more than the potential threats posed by dissidents and insurgents to their economic interests, what unsettled the middle classes most deeply was the threat posed to the monarchy. Ever since the revival of the monarchy’s stature under Sarit, the monarchy had gradually returned to its prior position in Thai society. For the middle classes in particular, as Anderson described it, it had</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[become] both a talisman and a moral alibi. The historical depth and solidity of the institution appeared as a kind of charm against disorder and disintegration … members of the middle strata felt their nationalist self-esteem morally guaranteed by their loyalty to the throne, the epitome of the national heritage. Thus any assault, however, indirect, on the legitimacy of the throne was necessarily sensed as a menace to that alibi. (Anderson 1977, 23)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The monarchy thus simultaneously stood for order and change, tradition and progress, and reconciled any tension between such concepts, a tension that would otherwise be felt the most strongly by the new middle classes. As a result, it would be necessary to defend the monarchy—a drive that would come to figure greatly in the present political crisis—against those that would seek to undermine it. Its most vociferous defenders would be the new middle classes, who, after the events of October 1973 and October 1976 had exposed both their economic and social vulnerabilities, had “forged a new sense of horizontal solidarity” that would continue to strengthen over the next decade and a half (Tsuruyo and Kagoya 2003, 245).</p>
